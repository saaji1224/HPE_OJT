EC2- Trouble shooting.

if get the below error while connecting to the ec2 instance need check below all possibilities.
Network error: timed out error.

1. Need to check with the security group --- 3389/22(windows(RDP) / tcp-linux) --> go to security group and check the open ports. 

2. Instance current status need check ...

3. Ec2 instance status checks 2/2 pass (Hard ware and fronted like os , network system and ebs volume is healthy)

      1/2 ---> N/W, Antivirus, EBS , Network interface need to check.===>>> need to stop and start
	 if stop and start at that time ec2 instance will move from one physical host to another physical host aws has its own alogitham that is follow when stop and start. 
	
	0/2-- hardware issues need to check.. 

4. Need to check instance screenshot from EC2 instance. 
	Actions--> monitor and troubleshoot ---> get instance screenshot (here show if any errors are there) BSOD error shows here

5. System logs form ec2 console.. 
	Actions--> monitor and troubleshoot ---> get system logs (shows the logs in that if any error for booting process or error for starting process )

6. Cloud trail ---> is there any recent changes to that instance.

	removed elastic ip /  removed any ebs volume /  assigned wrong volume 

	to check the activities need to copy insance id and search for cloud trail (open)--> event history --->> search with the insance id then we will get the logs /
 particular tasks which are done on instance.


 Any rule in place on ACL(access control list--> indicates which is allow or deny inbound or outbound traffic at the subnet level)
	Instacne--> networking--> VPC id(click)--> network ACL---> check with the inbound rule if any deny ---> 

8. Ec2 instance located in private or public subnet ( if located in public we can connect or else need to connect with nat gateway and public subnet.

9. VPC has IGW or  not..

10. VPC has proper route tables or not..(IGW entery or not we need to check)

1. S3 bucket showing Error access denied.( insufficient permissions to list objects)
2. S3 access column shows the "error" for all buckets
3. Troubleshoot "error" in the access field for buckets

point-1:  Check what is the status of other S3 buckets,whether all buckets are showing error or not.

point-2: Check IAM user/Role has the following permissions,
S3:GetAccountPubliAccessBlock
S3:GetBucketPubliAccessBlock
S3:GetBucketPolicyStatus
S3:GetBucketAcl	
S3:ListAccessPoints

point-3: Possible login from the root user and check what is the status of the error bucket.

point-4: check the bucket has any custom policy (root account)( goto s3>select properties only s3 policy can be edited by root user)

AMI IMAGE BACK UP PROCESS:--- ec2 instance->actions->image and templetes-->create image ----->.> one option ticmark enable reboot
advantages _--we can backup ,we cane share to different region and share the 	AMI IDS to different account ,we can use as a golden image..
