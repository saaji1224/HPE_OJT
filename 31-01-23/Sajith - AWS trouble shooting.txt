EC2- Trouble shooting.

if get the below error while connecting to the ec2 instance need check below all possibilities.
Network error: timed out error.

1. Need to check with the security group --- 3389/22(windows(RDP) / tcp-linux) --> go to security group and check the open ports. 

2. Instance current status need check ...

3. Ec2 instance status checks 2/2 pass (Hard ware and fronted like os , network system and ebs volume is healthy)

	1/2 ---> N/W, Antivirus, EBS , Network interface need to check.===>>> need to stop and start
	 if stop and start at that time ec2 instance will move from one physical host to another physical host aws has its own alogitham that is follow when stop and start. 
	
	0/2-- hardware issues need to check.. 

4. Need to check instance screenshot from EC2 instance. 
	Actions--> monitor and troubleshoot ---> get instance screenshot (here show if any errors are there) BSOD error shows here

5. System logs form ec2 console.. 
	Actions--> monitor and troubleshoot ---> get system logs (shows the logs in that if any error for booting process or error for starting process )

6. Cloud trail ---> is there any recent changes to that instance.

	removed elastic ip /  removed any ebs volume /  assigned wrong volume 

	to check the activities need to copy insance id and search for cloud trail (open)--> event history --->> search with the insance id then we will get the logs / perticular tasks which are done on instance. 

Network errors on EC2 instances:
____________________________________________________________________________________________________


7. Any rule in place on ACL(access control list--> indicates which is allow or deny inbound or outbound traffic at the subnet level)
	Instacne--> networking--> VPC id(click)--> network ACL---> check with the inbound rule if any deny ---> 

8. Ec2 instance located in private or public subnet ( if located in public we can connect or else need to connect with nat gateway and public subnet.

9. VPC has IGW or  not..

10. VPC has proper route tables or not..(IGW entery or not we need to check)

 S3-Trouble shooting:----

s3 bucket showing access denied / failed.
troubleshoot error in the access filed for buckets
s3 access column shows error for all buckets

trouble shoot points:---
__________________________

1 Check what is the status of the other s3 buckets, wether only perticular bucket showing error or all the buckets are showing the errror.
   			Access------> Error

in this scenario perticular bucket has some special permissions. 

objects can be public or not need to check .......

2. CHeck Iam user /roles has the following permissions. 

	getaccountpublicaccess block
	getaccountpublicaccessblock
	get bucket policy status
	getbucket acl
	list accesspoints

check with the iam user permissions.. 

3. Possible login from the root user and check what is the status of the error bucket.

after login as a root user need to  check for iam user permissions and s3 bucket level settings also need check..

after that chcek for the bucket if any error showing..

4. check for the bucke has any custom polices..

	check with IP ranges and all if any deny permission on the custom policy.

Auto scalling trouble shooting...(With out ELB auto scaling will not work)-- using cloud watch metric we can check cpu utilization.

auto scalling we can do in two ways.

1. horizantal ----adding ec2 instances 
2. vertical ---- increesing ec2 instance size....(here we have down time becaus low configured ec2 will be crash and creat new ec2 )


ec2 instances 3 or more, assigned elastic ip address and manged by ELB, elb will check for the health check of ec2 instances 

ELB must have target groups and that shoulbe configured with ASG.

Target group will be decide ec2 instance register / derigister...


Horizantal having 3 types:

1. dynamic (cpu uti >80%)
2. schedule scaling (perticular time)
3. predctive scaling(mechine learing algortiham)

solution: 

auto scalling group creation:

first need to creat auto scalling by using launch configaraion.

then based on above need to create auto scalling group.

need to metnion : Desired capacity(need to specify in b/w maximum and minimum capacity), minimum capacity, maximum capacity

Desired ---> while creating the asg how many instance need ...

need to configured threeshold volues like, cpu utilization..

scale in scal out...



 AWS EC2 Autoscaling issue.
 Troubleshooting scalling issues with my amazon ec2 auto scalling group.
 ec2 auto scalling group isnt following the scalling policy i configured
 ec2 auto scalling group is scalling out insted of scalling in
 ec2 auto scalling group is not responding to cloud watch alarm or health check replacement.
 ec2 auto saclling group is not responding to the sceduleed action.



1.Need to check scalling polices to see wehter an event triggers more than one policy...

	check for dynamic scalling policy , whether CPU utilization need to check 

2. Verfiy scale out and scale in policy are triggered at the same time..(scale out ---> create one more instance, scale in ---> derigister the ec2)

3.
