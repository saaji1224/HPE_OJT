configaration management:

like all details about mechine called configaration..

management: delete add etc..


if do any changes in mechine that is called configaration management.

manual --- system admins (install one packege in 1000 systems ---to do system admin will do in manual process)

automation --- to do in automation we use ansible/chef/puppet/salstack..

managing the configuration of mechine in a automated manner by using any tool is called configuration management tools.

source code managmeet --- by svn/git

cloud mangement by aws /azure...

we are going to manage a mechine configuration in a automated manner is called configuration management.

to install same package in 1000 mechines at once by using any one of configuration management tool..

Infrastructure as a code using we can install at once..

write a code and execute in all mechies ..

code to infra  ---> convert code in to infra called infrastructure as a code..

code we can place in git/ reuasable/ test /


configaration management:-- it is a method through which we automate admin tasks..
configaration management tool turns your code into infrastrucure..
so your code will be testable, repetable, versionable..

eg: software, netwroks, people, process..

Pain points: 
1. managing user and group accounts
2. Dealing with packages
3. Taking backup
4. Deploying all kind of applicaitons.
5. configuration services..

advantages:---
1.complete automation
2. Increase uptime
3. Improve performance
4. Ensure compliance
5. Prevent Errors
6. Reduce cost


	Why Ansible

1. Ansible is an adminstration tool, what ever system admins used to do manually, now we are automating all those tasks by using ansible..

2. can us this tool whether your servers are in on-promise or in the cloud

3. It turns your code into infrastrucer ..

versionable
repetable
testable

4. You only need to tell what the desired configuration should be, not how to achive it

5. Through automation , get desired state of server.

servers and nodes..

ansible install in servers only..

communicate with the nodes by servers..

we create file and write some code that is called playbook by using ymal code..

that code run in nodes.. in nodes actual infrastructue will be create..
--------------------------------------

need to setup module(security guard) . setup module go to nodes and collect the data and give the data to server, if already requiremenet is there then server will not install..

if package is not there then that should be install.

this process is called indempotence..

this idempotence achive by setupmodule

if we want to create a file (playbook) we need modules..(setup nothing but module)

Ansible used push mechanisam..

Vedio 3---:

Take 3 ec2 mechines.
1- ansible server
remaining 2 are nodes..

epel reposistary is availbale...

in that we have so many packages .. (ansible , git ,ssl, pip, python)

installation: ------
-------------------------------
Download epel
install epel
update mechine
install all dependencies...

1.wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
2.yum intall epel-
3. yum update -y
4. yum install git pyton python-devel python-pip openssl ansible -y
5. ansible --version

vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
in this passwordauthenication yes should be change
service sshd reload
ssh ansadmin@ip_address
ask password : give password

ssh (password less)--- should do in server only...
