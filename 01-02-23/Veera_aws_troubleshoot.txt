VPC:-for region max 5vpc we can create .
vpc create 
subents 
routetable edit rules asscoiations 
internet gate way 

use case :--creating two vpcs and peering each other and in one vpc creating two webservers and only doing public and private
peering :---is to connect two vpcs----requestor and acceptor ,another account differnt accounts account--ID,Another region in same aws account..

for cereating nat gate way we need public subnet and one elsatic ip -->>
so that db in public and given internet gate way and web server not given internet gate way 
so that to connect we need public ip of db and elastic ip
foe security purpose of servers we use ->>>>ACLS(access control list). security rules inbound and outbond.PORTS --.>>allow and deny using port nos.

KEY-MANAGEMENT SERVICE:---

it is used to create and manage keys and control use of encryption acreoss a wide range of aws security.
it is default keys in aws 
cmk keys:-customer managed keys 

properties:---Default Enceryption:--enable--(s3 -managed key) sse-s3
encryption key that amazon s3 creates ,manages and user for you
if we encrypt a bucket when we add objects after encryption it will be encrypted .


customer managed keys :---
first we should create key 
2types :--
1)symmetric and assymetric

1)symmetric keys :--
one single keys used for encyption and decryption the date and generates and verifies the HMAC codes

HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) is a type of a message authentication code (MAC) that is acquired by executing a
 cryptographic hash function on the data (that is) to be authenticated and a secret shared key. 
Like any of the MAC, it is used for both data integrity and authentication. 
Checking data integrity is necessary for the parties involved in communication. HTTPS, SFTP, FTPS, and other transfer protocols use HMAC. 
The cryptographic hash function may be MD-5, SHA-1, or SHA-256. Digital signatures are nearly similar to HMACs i.e they both employ a hash function and a shared key. 
The difference lies in the keys i.e
HMACs use symmetric key(same copy) 

2)asymmetric :----
a public key and private key pair used fro ecryption and decryption data or singing and verfiying the messages .

key rotation service:-automatically rotate this key every year .
Schedule key Deletion:--we cant't delete immediately waiting period 7 to 30 days notice periods .

ELASTIC LOAD-BALANCING:---

Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes your incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses,
 in one or more Availability Zones.
 It monitors the health of its registered targets, and routes traffic only to the healthy targets. 
types :--application and classic

Troubleshooting:--
application load balancer:-
.)load balacer backend instances status in service /Healthy
.)if load balacers backend instances state is out of service/unhealthy
.)check the health of instances 2/2 check is passed or not .
.) ckeck security groups and acl for required ports is opened or not 
.)ckeck default vpc in acls ports is allowed/deny of required .
.)load balancer health check configuration need to be verified .
.)try to restart the application service inside of backend ec2 instances .
.)check for the ALB forwarding rules comfigured proprely.
.)check the public and private subnets 
.)check vpc for IGW(interior gateway ) is connected or not .
.)cloud trail:-ckeck any recent changes to that instances.
.)finally check the instance statrt and stop.
