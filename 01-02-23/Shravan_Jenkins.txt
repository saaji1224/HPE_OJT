Jenkins follow the master and slave architecture.

Master Node:-- 
Master  node will work lika scheduler , which is managed and schedule on the worker
schedule the build jobs
Like if we have 100 jobs that will that 100 jobs will scheduled to each slave based on capcity.

Dispactcing build to the slave for the execution.

monitor the slave

recordingt and prestenting the build result

slave:--

A slave is a java executaable that runs on a remove mechine

it haears requestsfrom the jenkins master instance

slave can run an a verity of operting system

the job of a slave it to do as they are told to which involves execcuting build jobs dispatching byn\ the master

Declartative pipeline:

pipeline{
	agentany{
	stages{
		stage(INIT){
			steps{
			}
		stage(Build){
			steps{
			}
		stage(Deploy){
			steps{
			}
		}
	}
}

Standard:

node
Stage('Build')
	{
		steps
	}
stage('Test'){
	steps
}
stage('Deploy)
	{
	steps
