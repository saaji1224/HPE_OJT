How do you handle build failures in Jenkins?
Handling build failures in Jenkins involves the following steps:

Monitor build status: Regularly monitor the build status in the Jenkins web interface to quickly identify build failures.

Review build logs: Review the build logs to identify the cause of the build failure. 
Build logs provide detailed information about the build process, including any error messages or exceptions.

Troubleshoot the issue: Troubleshoot the issue causing the build failure by following established 
troubleshooting procedures or by seeking help from the development team or community forums.

Update the build process: Update the build process to prevent similar build failures in the future.
 This may involve updating build scripts, configuring build dependencies, or modifying build steps.

Re-run the build: Re-run the build once the issue has been resolved. 
Verify that the build is successful and that the build artifacts are generated correctly.

Document the issue: Document the issue causing the build failure and the steps taken to resolve it.
 This information can be useful for future reference and for continuous improvement of the build process.

By following these steps, you can effectively handle build failures in Jenkins and keep your build environment running smoothly
